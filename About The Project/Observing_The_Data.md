# Observations about the data:

We can see that after February of 2020, the number of rides daily plummeted due to the pandemic. Before the pandemic there were on average of 7500 rides per day, versus 
after the pandemic was officially declared there were less than a 1000 rides per day on UIC-Halsted.


Another observation, which is rather obvious, is that over the weekends there is much less riders to all stations. 
This is most likely due to the fact that people don’t commute for work.


After looking at more long-term data specific to UIC-Halsted, I noticed that the number of average riders daily between 2001 – 2010 is 
lower than the average riders between 2011 – 2019. Some factors to this could be potentially more commuters attending university considering 
that UIC-Halsted is the closest station to UIC.
