# Introduction:

This is a data visualization application that allows a user to select a certain year and certain CTA Train station and view the number of rides per day, 
per month and aggregate number of rides on a certain day of the week throughout the year. This application uses R-Studio to read in and process the data 
which is then hosted on Shinyapps.io to allow the user to take a look at the data to make their observations. 
To view these data in data table or bar chart form, select the year and train station from the side menu bar and the bar chart and data table will automatically
display the number of rides from that certain year at a particular CTA station.
